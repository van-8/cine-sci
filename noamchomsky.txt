As a Taiwanese-American living the last 12 years in China, my personal journey has been a rollercoaster of reevaluation. The   misrepresentations of all sides only become clear after decades of persistent curiosity, and Wittgenstein's insight of "Die Grenzen meiner Sprache bedeuten die Grenzen meiner Welt" forecast a future where human conflict perists. 

I've begun writing a TV series script to try and defuse a potential 3rd World War between the US and China.


The US war machine seems still unashamed of its crimes & untethered in its aggression, while China's technocrats 


Purpose: Create  

A truly intercultural, multilingual "Star Trek: The Next Generation" TV series. Cinematic parables that glamorize science, not violence.
Playground for thought experiments & social commentary. Struggles of being an ethical, kind person in a chaotic world. 

Inspire kindness and competence. 
Characters make mistakes, but then display acknowledgement, responsibility, correction, and reconciliation.


What shows or stories have inspired you?
What themes would you like to see explored ?
If there was a character based on you (a rigorous public intellectual that challenges manufactured consent), 


Below are some thematics for your consideration.

万古流芳


Complexity
The infrastructure that enables modern life is incredibly complex. Those who seek to become engineers, doctors, and lawyers require years of education and continual qualification. Even yoga teachers are expected to be certified so as not to endanger the public. Yet government officials & leaders are chosen by beauty pagent. Perhaps public elections work well at populations under 10 million citizens, but do not scale effectively to larger organizations. 


Degeneracy (biology)
Defined by biologists as "the ability of structurally different elements to perform similarly under certain conditions, but perform distinct functions in other conditions." Degeneracy is observed in the natural world (genes, protein folding, neuroanatomy) and also in our constructed world (governance structures, economic paradigms, cultural norms.) America's evangelical obsession to "convert" other peoples to its values & systems is not only harmful and misguided, but may reduce the robustness of human civilization.



Synbio
Synthetic biology will enable the creation anything, from designer hallucinegenics to miniature pet giraffes.


Genetic Diversification
As natural selection pressures disappear, our species may diversify like arthopods, with fantastically different physical & mental characteristics. 


Scaling Cooperation
From small social groups to now global civilization, what biological characteristics might be selected for/against?


Enjoyable Inefficiency
What activities will still be "fun" even if technologies supercede them? Roasting food on a fire, camping, romance, 


Inter-parity
Synthetic sensory inputs will be indistuishable from (and may surpass) physical sensations. This parity between base reality and metareality will create opportunity, confusion, and conflict. 


Freedom of Expression
The danger of misinformation is clear, especially to those with poor critical thinking faculties: death. I'm now more familiar with China's tightly moderated online discourse and forcing citizens to use qualified platforms or official redress channels . Debate between qualified professionals rage on platforms that verify credentials (好大夫 for medical professionals, 法律智讯网 , but are shielded from amateur commentary.
