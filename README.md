## Cinematic science: charts, citations, &amp; consensus

###### Collaborators: Prof Lisa F Barrett (Northeastern), Joseph Friedman, PhD (Northeastern), Veritasium (Derek Mueller), NASA


### Research Motivation
1. Humans evolved story-telling to share units of knowledge with each other
2. Memorable stories are carefully crafted, narratively engaging, and visually beautiful
3. Science is the process of validating knowledge
4. Science most deserves to be crafted into beautiful, engaging stories.

### Overview
1. Formalize a framework of best practices for collaboration between professional scientists and filmmakers collaboration 
2. Improve the framework through peer-review by established scientist/filmmaker teams, as well as workshopping with less-experienced groups
3. Apply the framework to produce a proof of concept 
4. Evaluate the framework by altering and testing the cinematic publication proof-of-concept with audiences, varying features that may influence viewers’ informal learning; 
5. Iteratively refine the framework based on the evaluation, and create a video tutorial and white-paper for release to all parties interested in creating ‘cinematic publication’.

### Intellectual Merit
1. In the age of digital video, scientists should be empowered to work shoulder-to-shoulder with creatives in sharing their science.
2. Decisions investigators/creatives make influence the public's perception of science. Does airbrushing out numbers and graphs distort how science is perceived? Does not showing the arduous process of science distort its perceived value? Can crafting an unraveling mystery be more memorable than a plain exposition? Does hiding peer review distort the idea of organized skepticism? Does designing memorable memes catalyze more sharing and discussion?
3. Realistic science is finding mainstream success.

### Broader Impacts
1. Frameworks are powerful. Just as Hollywood's Save-the-Cat and Silicon Valley's Agile accelerate these industries, we aim to create one for informal STEM content.
2. Inclusiveness for scientists around the world. Vânia Teóflio is from Cape Verde.
3. Inclusiveness for different cultural groups. Brat James is woman of color dancer/choreographer from the Bronx.
4. Inclusiveness for more languages in science content. Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Japanese to reach more populations.
5. Inclusiveness for deaf/hard-of-hearing community. Create signs for neuroscience terms.
